        <h1>Tiger</h1>
        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its black stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>

        <p>If you’re lucky enough to see a white tiger, it may be an albino or the result of a genetic mutation. If it’s <b> white with black</b> stripes and has blue eyes, this coloration is caused<i>by a genetic mutation</i>  called leucism and is specific to the Bengal tiger. <hr>hrBoth parents</hr> must have the gene for a white cub to occur. It’s<br> rare, however, only resulting in one out of 10,000 births.An albino tiger, on the other hand, would be entirely white (no black stripes or very, very faint stripes) and have pink eyes.Few white tigers survive in the wild because their white fur doesn’t provide any camouflage protection for the tiger.</p>
